# Unreal Engine 5 Mass Test

This is a small demo project which goes through Epic Games' video [Large Number of Entities with Mass in UE5](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/talks-and-demos/37Oz/large-numbers-of-entities-with-mass-in-unreal-engine-5)

I used Unreal Engine 5.3.1, and at this point there are some small differences between the video and the final code in the project.

The video didn't come the full code samples so this tackles the simple movement and advanced movement.  There are two different assets representing each one:

1. DA_Entity (Simple Movement)
2. DA_AdvancedEntity

Simply apply the correct Entity Config on the MassSpawner in the `Main` level and hit "play".
